In the early 1990s, I wrote a Gopher client and server for VM/CMS.
This was in the pre-dawn of the World Wide Web and Gopher was hot.
CMS Gopher was well received and I got all kinds of enhancement requests.
One biggie: use a message repository. Really? Seemed like such a hassle:
call a message handler instead of simply writing out English messages?
But the VM community kept up the pressure, so I bowed. Turned out that
'XMITMSG' in CMS was easy to use. Shortly, message repositories for
other languages were provided and CMS Gopher was the only multi-language
Gopher on the planet.

I came to love 'XMITMSG' and wanted something like it for Unix.
To fill the need, I put together a crude C program that could read
the same syntax as the CMS message repository. The command worked
much like its CMS counterpart (but with Unix option syntax, of course).
But I had a lot to learn about making things extensible and functional.

In 2013, the GitHub guys offered a free intro to Git at Ohio State.
I took it and started tinkering with collaborative projects.
In 2014, I created this 'xmitmsgx' project.
